- ABOUT XBOX CONTROLLER:
	- may work in 2 modes -- wireless and via cable
	- wireless: make sure batteries are full; press center (round) btn (it should blick slowly); hold "net" btn from behind (now center btn should blink frequently);
	connect bluetooth adapter to PC; from windows settings connect controller (first option). Goes off after some time of nothing-doing
	- via cable: doesn't need batteries and never goes off
- ABOUT SOUND:
	- in Oculus App tap on device -> audio and mic should use Windows settings, not itself
	- sound delay:
		- intercom researcher to participant -- 172ms
		- intercom participant to researcher -- 165ms
		- play single Console.Beep() 	     -- 110ms
